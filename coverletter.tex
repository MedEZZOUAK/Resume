\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Software Engineer with a State Engineering Degree in Computer Science from ENSA Tétouan, specializing in backend systems and production environments. I currently work at ITSS Paris in Casablanca, where I own the backend of the \textbf{IJConnect} platform (Django), ensuring functional continuity, implementing WebSocket features, and handling application maintenance and TMA for large enterprise clients. I am used to working under performance, reliability, and operational constraints, and I am comfortable with effort estimation, functional validation, and delivery planning in multi-client ESN contexts. I am trilingual (Arabic, French, English) and committed to building reliable systems that deliver measurable value.

\lettersection{Why Your Company?}
I am keen to join a team where backend quality, production stability, and clear processes matter. I am looking for an environment where I can contribute to meaningful products, grow technically, and work with modern stacks and practices. I am motivated by challenges such as scaling systems, improving performance, and delivering features that users and stakeholders rely on. If your company values ownership, continuous improvement, and collaboration with both technical and business teams, I believe I can fit in and contribute from day one.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My experience spans backend ownership on Django-based systems, incident resolution and corrective fixes in production, and performance tuning (SQL optimization, indexing, connection pool issues). At Lear Corporation I designed and developed an internal web platform end-to-end, digitizing recruitment and certification workflows and building operational dashboards from production data; I also delivered a computer-vision-based defect detection prototype in a Just-In-Time manufacturing context. I have worked with Python (Django), Java (Spring Boot), PHP (Symfony), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and CI/CD, and I am at ease with both greenfield development and evolving existing systems. I would be glad to discuss how this background can support your team and your roadmap.
